# Deployment Files

The templates here can be used to setup a deployment. I'll worry about
automating these steps later.

## Start a deployment

To deploy the system, run `python deploy.py` - you shouldn't need to install
any dependencies.

## Send to S3

The `send_to_s3.sh` script sends all the compiled static assets to AWS S3.
